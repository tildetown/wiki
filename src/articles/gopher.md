Gopher Wiki
============

Gopher is a pre-web internet protocol based on a hierarchy of menus and documents.
To get started with Gopher on the town, make a `public_gopher` directory in your home and it will be listed on the main menu of [gopher://tilde.town](gopher://tilde.town)
Create a file named `gophermap` to add information, links, and labels for files.
