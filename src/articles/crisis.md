Where can this be applied?
--------------------------

This document was written specifically for tilde.town's IRC chat in mind, but these
guidelines can be more broadly applied to places like mastodon, bbj, mail,
MUD/MUSH, other online spaces, or even in-person/meatspace environments.

What is a crisis?
-----------------

By 'crisis', this document specifically refers to suicidal threats or behavior.
This document is an overview of crisis response in an online community setting.

Identifying a crisis
--------------------

**Yellow Flags:** 

* sudden unannounced deletion of content (public_html, feels posts, mastodon account, etc.)
* sudden disappearances for long-ish periods of time, followed by suspicious dismissal ("oh it was nothing, i just had an accident, i'm ok")
* talking about getting rid of physical belongings, especially if they were
  previously treasured objects
* idle thoughts about hopelessness, escape, wishing to not exist ("no one will miss me", 
"i'm not worth anything")

These may warrant a kind/gentle check-in, but don't necessarily
indicate imminent danger. 

**Example:** consider dropping someone a line with "hey, I noticed
{something}, are you doing okay?"

**Red Flags:** 

* discussing actual plans or methods ("I think I'm going to go jump off a bridge")
* explicit goodbyes ("Slitting my wrists now, goodbye everyone")

These could indicate an imminent danger, and should be treated as
serious threats to life; see "Appropriate Responses" below for suggested
handling.

Appropriate responses
---------------------

If you think someone is considering suicide, **engage with them directly and
immediately**, preferably in a way that's as close to where you saw a warning
sign as possible (if it was a feels post, send them an email or a PM on IRC if
you know that they check those; if it was in an IRC channel, talk to them in
that channel or PM them, if it was on Mastodon, send them a DM, etc.)

Talking to someone about suicide is not going to make their situation worse; in
a best case scenario, they were just joking/venting and will admit so, and you
might both be a little embarrassed that it came up (and in that case, they know
that someone cares!). If they are actually in a suicidal state, engaging with
them directly is the best approach. **Ask them specific questions, and believe
what they are saying**.

**If you have a strong suspicion that they need immediate medical attention and
you know where they are, try to contact local emergency responders in their
area**. However, keep in mind that **a potential police presence might not be the
best response**, especially for trans/disabled/neuroatypical folks; use your best
judgement in this situation, and **reach out to your fellow townies for
advice/feedback if you're not sure who to call**. Someone else may be more
knowledgeable about a particular person's situation. In any case, remember that
you might be dealing with a life or death situation, so drastic options may be
justified. Prioritize reaching medical professionals whenever possible.

Here are some potential responses if there's an urgent need to get through to
someone in a suicidal state:

* specific questions ("are you thinking about killing yourself?" "do you have a
  plan?" "where are you right now?")
* directing them to help ("please call a local friend/family and talk to them",
  "here is the number for a suicide hotline, please text them right now before
  you do anything else")
* help them make a plan to survive with specific steps ("can you go get a drink
  of water right now?", "please put {thing} in a drawer and close it, then go
  sit on the couch")
* listen to them closely and compassionately, and remind them that you are
  there for them ("hey, i'm sorry this sucks, but i'm listening", "we care
  about you here")
* thank them for speaking or sharing their feelings
* stay present for them; if you have to step away for any reason
  (even/especially for self-care), try to make sure another community member
  will be present, and also announce that you're stepping away for a moment
  ("hey, i have to be away from the keyboard for {time}, but please talk to
  {person}; i'll be back {soon/later} if you need me)
* [more detailed talking strategies](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/)

In a less immediate context, suggest mental health treatment, and be supportive
of their attempts to take care of themselves. Remember that suicidal thoughts
are an expression of disordered mental activity, and professional help is
always an appropriate thing to seek out.

Inappropriate responses
----------------------

If you cannot or do not feel comfortable contributing an appropriate response,
**it is better to not respond at all**. Similarly, if you notice someone else
making unhelpful responses, consider sending them a PM and request that they
step back until the situation calms down.

These responses can be extremely harmful or get in the way of helping, both to
an individual experiencing a crisis, and to the community's ability to respond
as a whole. It is understandably frustrating and difficult to witness a person
in crisis, but please take a deep breath and exercise some
compassion. **You are always free to step away from your computer** for a few 
moments.

In general, avoid:

* questioning their intent ("you're not really going to kill yourself, right?")
* joking about their situation ("haha okay glhf")
* belittling them, or making disparaging comments ("just shut up about this",
  "no one cares")
* guilt-tripping them ("think about how sad i'll be!", "what about all your
  friends?", "so many people have it worse than you")
    * note: there's a fine line between reminding them that you care and
      guilt-tripping them about their plans; if you can, try to focus on how
      you feel about them in the moment, instead of what might happen if they
      die
* keeping their behavior a secret (suicidal ideation is serious and lethal, and
  bringing awareness of the situation to the community as a whole can help)
* making broad statements about their life if you don't know their
  situation/environment well ("well, i'm sure if you did {thing} then this will
  all be better")

Less dangerous crises
---------------------

Less dangerous crises, such as depression or financial hardship,
while possible contributors to suicidal actions, are not in scope for this
guide.

Difficulties of online suicide prevention
-----------------------------------------

The difficult part of this situation is the lack of immediate physical access
to someone in danger; we cannot necessarily go to someone's side and comfort
them, or take them to a hospital if they've hurt themselves. The best thing we
can do as a community is to provide support, love, and help each other connect
to life-saving resources.

On remaining quiet
------------------

If you find yourself witnessing a crisis, but cannot bring yourself to
contribute to the immediate intervention, that's okay! It's also important to
just be there and have eyes on the situation. If you don't feel comfortable
engaging a suicidal person, but want to provide support to the situation,
consider sending a PM to anyone who's helping them out to say that you see
them, affirm their efforts, and offer them good vibes <3

Self-care
---------

Witnessing someone in a crisis is extremely draining; it is normal to feel
panic, anxiety, helplessness, etc. It can get overwhelming and scary. If there
are other people who are present, consider sending them a private message for
some solidarity and support; even just having a group hug and sense of
community and collective suffering can be a tremendous help.

Suicidal behavior is an irrational mental state, and if you are not a trained
professional, there are no expectations that you "fix" anything. As a friend
and a member of the community, the best thing you can do is maintain a
compassionate approach, support each other, and be good to yourselves.

In short, take care of yourself; try not to put yourself in a bad place in
order to help someone else.
