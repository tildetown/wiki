# Learn to Read and Type Chinese

by m455

## Introduction

So you want to learn Chinese? Great! As I have no means of
teaching you how to pronounce Chinese or Pinyin via this
document, this book will only teach you how to read and type
Chinese. I also recommend mastering Pinyin before you start
these lessons. Pinyin is the romanized, pronunciation system
that Chinese speakers use in dictionaries and it is also the
same system they use to type Chinese characters. Once you
master the pronunciation of Pinyin, you will be able to
pronounce any words that you come across. This is because
you can find the Pinyin (the pronunciation systemfor
Chinese) in dictionaries.

If you want a really quick guide on pronounciation, I've
written one
[here](http://tilde.town/~m455/a-quick-guide-to-pronouncing-chinese-words.html)
for people who don't have a lot of time. The pronounciation
examples aren't accurate though. They were just given as
a quick reference to English speakers who are looking at which
sounds in Chinese sound similar to those in English.

Before we begin, I recommend [setting up a Chinese input
method](http://tilde.town/~m455/how-to-set-up-a-chinese-input-method-on-gnulinux.html)
for the operating system you are using. This way you can
practice typing Chinese. It will also help you become more
familiar with the characters. Although, it may not help you
speak, write and listen, but at least you’ll be able to type
and read, which is what I aim to teach you.


### A few things I want you to remember

* There is no "right" way or “professional” way to learn
a language.

* The more you study, practice (with a native speaker,
friend or by yourself), and expose yourself to the language
via reading, listening, watching, and even writing, the more
you will excel at the language.

* Listen to yourself when you speak. Examples: your accent,
rhythm and nuances.

* If you feel like you forgot everything because you haven't
studied in a while, get back at it and you will soon see
that you didn't forget everything.

* Last, but certainly not least, you can do it! Don’t
compare yourself with others!

### A few more details on Chinese:

* There are no pronunciation inconsistencies when it comes
to Pinyin. 

* Please do not rely on Pinyin when reading, just read the
characters. 

* Only rely on Pinyin for pronunciation.

* Everywhere in China has their own regional variety of the
language which is often unintelligible to people who do not
speak that variety. Because of this, the lingua franca,
Mandarin, was created and about 2-3000 commonly used Chinese
characters were simplified, leaving the rest of the
characters untouched, in order to lower illiteracy rates and
allow people to communicate more easily when travelling
around.

* There are about 60,000 characters in total, many of which
are not used very often, but still preserved. 

* Sometimes people will speak Mandarin with an accent
influenced by their variety 

* People from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan will use
traditional characters while people from Mainland China and
Singapore use simplified characters. 

* Although people in the Guangdong province speak Cantonese,
they do not use traditional characters.

* Being able to read both simplified and traditional
characters will help you a lot.

## How to type Chinese characters

If you type "wo", the “我” character will appear above the
words you are typing. You can choose this character by
hitting the spacebar. You can also type whole sentences and,
if all of the characters that appear on the screen are the
ones you want, you can just hit spacebar and it will choose
all of the characters in the sentence.

**Example:** 

Typing "wobushita" may give you “我不是他”, which you can
then choose by hitting space bar. 

If you need to select individual characters in a sentence
while typing, you can use numbers or arrow keys to choose
which characters you want.

**Example:**

Typing "woxihuanheniunai" may give you “我喜欢喝牛奶”.

We can then see that all of the character options begin to
showing up, and that "我" can be chosen by typing the number
beside it. On mine, it’s 1, so I type “1” and it will select
“我” for me. You can continue to select the characters you
need in order to finish a sentence. Most input methods will
learn by themselves which characters you will most often.
This allows the input to become more convenient over time if
you are using it often. Input methods in this manner are
needed as the Chinese language has many words that sound the
same.

If you want to type English in the middle of your sentence,
you can type a word in English, while using a Chinese input
method, and then hit the enter key, this will choose and
keep the romanized letters you type.

## Tone Rules

In Chinese there are a few rules that apply when two or more
tones come before or after one another, as well as a couple
of characters which have their own rules. In this guide
I will be labeling tones with numbers rather than accents. 

### Common representation of tones with accents:

1st Tone: mā

2nd Tone: má

3rd Tone: mǎ

4th Tone: mà

5th/neutral Tone: ma

### My representation of tones for this guide:

1st Tone: ma1

2nd Tone: ma2

3rd Tone: ma3

4th Tone: ma4

5th/Neutral Tone: ma

The reason I’ve chosen to represent the tones this way is
because when you are clarifying which tone someone is saying
in spoken Chinese, you will be able to recall which tones
correlate to which number more easily.

**Note:**

The neutral tone can be heard when native speakers say the
word "吗" (Question marker at the end of a sentence in
Chinese), as an example, as well as many other words.

### Where you should write the tones

I am covering a bit on the tone accents above the characters
before I start using my representation of the tones because
there are some fundamentals that are standard, usually, when
writing tones. 

All of you have to remember is the order of the pinyin
vowels: a o e i u ü. 

These vowels will help you determine above which letter the
tone will be placed.

**Example:**

The tones in"你好/nihao" would be written as “nǐhǎo”. This
is because we look at which vowels in each Chinese character
come first (two vowels in this case).

In "ni" the first, and only, vowel is “i” so the tone goes
over the “i”, but in “hao” we have two vowels. Which one
comes first in the sequence above? (“a” in this case, so the
tone goes over the “a”.)

There is one exception that I can think of, though, and that
is the "iu" combination. For this combination, the “u” gets
the tone. 

Example: 就/jiù.

Don't worry too much about where to write the tones above
the pinyin. If you place the tone above the wrong letter, it
won’t change the meaning of the word and native speakers
will still understand you. 

**Note:**

I wouldn’t recommend using 拼音/pin1yin1 to communicate with
native speakers. Try to start using Chinese characters to
communicate as soon as possible.

### Connecting Tones

When certain tones and certain characters are connected,
tone changes may occur. Luckily for you, I'm going to make
a list so you can see how they change below!

**Two 3rd tones:** 

你好/ni3hao3 → ni2hao3

"Hello"

**Three 3rd tones:**

我很好/wo3hen3hao3 → wo3hen2hao3

"I’m well"

**Four 3rd tones (or more) together:**

我很想你/wo3hen3xiang3ni3 → wo2hen3xiang2ni3

"I really miss you"

**一/yi1 + 4th tone:**

一个/yi1ge4 → yi2ge4

"A"; “One” (Quantity, not the number one)

**Note:**

When saying a series of numbers or counting, the tone does
not change on "一", so use the first tone “一/yi1” (“一/yi1”
means “one”).
**不/bu4 + 4th tone:**

不是/bu4shi4 → bu2shi4

"Not"; “Is not”

This may seem overwhelming at first—it was for me—but don't
worry. Just remember that when two 3rd tones come together,
the first one turns to a 2nd tone and when the "一" or “不”
characters come before a character with a fourth tone, the
“一” or “不” take the 2nd tone.

**Note:** 

If any tone changes occur, I will remind you of them beside
the original Pinyin in parentheses, located in the vocabulary
section below. In future chapters I won't provide them, so
you can practice doing them on the fly.

### Vocabulary

**王文/wang2wen2** - A full name. The first character,
\"王\" is a common surname. The second character is the
first name. In Chinese the last name is said first when you
say a full name, but it is uncommon to call someone by their
name/full name. 王：King 文：Pattern

**李夏蓓/li3xia4bei4** - A full name. The first character, "李" is a common surname.
The second and third characters, "夏蓓" are the first name.
李：Plum 夏：Summer (夏天/xia4tian1) 蓓：Flower bud
(蓓蕾/bei4lei3)

**你好/ni3hao3** (**ni2hao3**) - "Hello" You can also use it to get someone\'s attention on
the street or in a restaurant.  你：You 好：Good/Very Note:
Some learners will get this mixed up with "你好吗" which
means "How are you?", not "Hello".

**啊/a1** - This can be added on the end of
sentences/utterances/responses to soften the tone of what is
being said.

**吗/ma** - This is a question particle that can be added to the end of
things to turn a statement into a question. Example: 你好
(Hello) → 你好吗？(How are you?)

**很/hen3** - "very" The "very" connotation can be omitted sometimes.
Example: "我很好" can either mean "I\'m very well" or "I\'m
well". Don\'t worry too much about this, you will understand
through context.

**呢/ne** - This is a particle that can be used at the end of sentences
to inquire about something, so "你呢" in this case means
"How about you?" or "and you?".

**也/ye3** - "too"; "also"

**谢谢/xie4xie** - "Thank you"

**是/shi4** - "To be"; "is" If you add "吗" after it, it means "Is that
so?" ("是吗？")

**老师/lao3shi1** - "teacher" "老" means "old" "师" is a suffix for some
professions. Example: "律师/lv4shi1" means "lawyer"

**不/bu4** - A negator. Example: "不是/bu4shi4" means "is not", literally
"not is". Negators in Chinese come before the verb. Note the
tone change for "不是/bu4shi4" to "bu2shi4"

**学生/xue2sheng1** - "student" "学" means "to learn" ("学习" means "to study")
"生" means "raw"; "to give birth" and many other things.

**工作/gong1zuo4** - "to work"; "work" This word can be used as a verb or a noun.

**真的/zhen1de** - "Really"; "Real" "Really", in this case, is a statement, not
an adjective. Example: A: "真的吗？"("Really?") B:
"真的！"("Really!")

**想 or 想要/xiang3 or xiang3yao4** - "to want"; "want to"; "wish to" Most of the time "想" and
"想要" can be used interchangeably, but "想要" feels
a little softer.

**应该/ying1gai1** - "should"; "ought to" Sometimes you will see "该". The
difference is subtle, but, in general you can think of it as
the same thing.

**好好学习/hao3hao3xue2xi2** (**hao2hao3xue2xi2**) - "Study hard"; "Study well" This is a common phrase that
people use.  Sometimes they will say "好好学习天天向上".
A rough translation of this phrase would be "Study hard and
improve every day".

**好的/hao3de** - "Okay"; "Alright"

**那/na4 or 那么/na4me** - "Then..."; "Well then..."

**再见/zai4jian4** - "Goodbye"; "Farewell" This is a stronger, more emotional
goodbye that isn\'t used as often as "拜拜".  It could
indicate that you are leaving for a long time, but some
people will still use it, although, "拜拜" is more common.

**拜拜/bai1bai1** - "Bye bye"; "Goodbye" Sometimes, people will use "88" to say
goodbye on the internet, because "拜拜/bai1bai1" sounds like
"八八/ba1ba1 (eight eight)".  Note: There are a lot of
number combinations that people use to express phrases.
Example: "520/五二零/wu3er4ling2" sounds like
"我爱你/wo3ai4ni3" ("I love you").
