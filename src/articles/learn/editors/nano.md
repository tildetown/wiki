# How to use nano

Nano is a simple to use text editor.

Start it by typing `nano` on the command line, optionally followed by the name of a file to edit.

```
$ nano ~/public_html/index.html
```

Nano's editing commands are listed at the bottom of the screen. When you see a `^` character, it indicates the Ctrl key. So, for example, `^O Write Out` means press Ctrl-O to save your work, and `^X Exit` means press Ctrl-X to exit. Pretty straight forward!
