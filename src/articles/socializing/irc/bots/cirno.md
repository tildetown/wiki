cirno
=====

Owner: **desvox** *(unconfirmed*) (if you're the owner, please confirm by including your name in !cirnohelp)

*An IRC bot that sits in the local server.*

## Commands and more info

* **!setv <key> <value>** Set value **<value>** to key **<key>**, retrivable in in the future using **!getv**
* **!getv <key>** Get value associated with key **<key>**, if a value is already set for key **<key>** using **!setv**

**Note:** The above commands can be sent to **cirno** in any channel that it's in, and also using IRC private messages (**/query cirno**).

**Note 2:** **cirno** has other commands too, which one can find more about by running **!cirnohelp <modulename>**. A list of module names can be obtained by running **!rollcall** (this will also make all other bots respond and thus flood the chat, so use with caution or send a private message to **cirno** with **!rollcall**).
