cirno
=====

**Owner:** desvox

*An IRC bot that does random stuff.*

## Commands and more info

* **!setv &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;** Set value **&lt;value&gt;** to key **&lt;key&gt;**, retrivable in the future using **!getv**

* **!getv &lt;key&gt;** Get value associated with key **&lt;key&gt;**, if a value is already set for key **&lt;key&gt;** using **!setv**

**Note:** The above commands can be sent to **cirno** in any channel that it's in, and also using IRC private messages (**/query cirno**).

**Note 2:** **cirno** has other commands too, which one can find more about by running **!cirnohelp &lt;modulename&gt;**. A list of module names can be obtained by running **!rollcall** (this will also make all other bots respond and thus flood the chat, so use with caution or send a private message to **cirno** with **!rollcall**).
