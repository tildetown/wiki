## Composing emails in mutt

mutt uses whatever you have specified in the `$EDITOR` environment variable as an editor for composing email.
So make sure to add something like `export EDITOR=emacs` to your `.bashrc`.
Emacs also supports [mail-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MailMode) for composing emails.
