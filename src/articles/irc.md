irc
===

tilde.town has a local irc server! please abide by the
[code of conduct](https://tilde.town/wiki/conduct.html), and contact a
moderator if you have problems. volunteer moderators are designated as ops in
the main channel (they'll have an '@' in front of their name)

the `chat` command will automatically start a weechat session and connect to
the server. you can also use
[irssi](irssi.html).

## tildeverse irc

~town is also part of a wider network of tildes: [tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat).
the tilde.chat network is run by member nodes (currently ~town, tilde.team, and yourtilde.com)
and exists as a place to share and collaborate with other tilde members.

to connect, you can use the configuration settings on the [tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat) site and connect
with those credentials.

or, you can follow these steps to connect through the ~town node:

in chat (which is weechat btw):
<pre><code>
/server add tildeverse 127.0.0.1/7766
/connect tildeverse
</code></pre>

connecting through the town node grants you access to the town-only channel #town. besides the other
local channels on each member node, all other channels are shared across tildes and will be visible to
other tilde members.

tilde.chat has the same expectations of culture and sharing and kindness as the internal irc chat.
come share the love :)
