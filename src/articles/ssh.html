  <h2><em>or, how to connect to another computer and tell it to do cool things</em></h2>

  <h3>
    **** if you just want to get right to a tutorial you can <a href="#tutorial">skip over this background info</a> ****
  </h3>

  <p>
    While <a href="https://tilde.town">tilde.town</a> is accessible on the web
    and features lovely web pages written by its users, all of the interaction
    with tilde.town takes place <strong>inside the computer</strong> that runs
    tilde.town as opposed to via web forms that have an effect
    from <strong>outside</strong> tilde.town's computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what sets tilde.town apart from most other online communities. You
    connect directly to another computer from yours alongside other people and
    then write your web pages, chat, and play games all via text-based
    interfaces right on tilde.town's computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to the web (which debuted in 1995) this is how pretty much all
  computer stuff got done. You connected directly to a machine (usually over a
  direct, physical phone line) and did your work there.
  </p>

  <p>For a long time, people used a tool called <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet"><code>telnet</code></a> to
connect to other computers. These days we use a tool called
<strong>ssh</strong>.
</p>

  <p><code>ssh</code> is a text-based tool that provides a direct connection
  from your computer to another. ssh is an acronym that stands for Secure Shell.
  The <em>Shell</em> part refers to the fact that it's a text-based tool; we use
  the word shell to refer to a text-based interface that you give commands to.
  The <em>Secure</em> part refers to the fact that, when you're using ssh, no
    one can spy on your connection to another computer (unlike the
    old <code>telnet</code> command).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>why bother with all of this?</strong> passwords are really insecure
    and hard to manage. Using keys makes life easier for you, fair user (your
    account is less likely to be hacked) and for me, your humble sysadmin (less
    administration than passwords).
  </p>

  <h2>ssh tutorial!</h2>
  <p>
    The end goal of this tutorial is to make a <strong>key pair</strong>. That's
  a set of two files full of numbers and letters. One file is public
  (your <em>public key</em>) and the other private (your <em>private key</em>).
  You'll be submitting the public key in the sign-up form and using the private
  key when you connect to tilde.town using ssh.

    choose your operating system:
    <a href="#windows">windows</a> |
    <a href="#osx">mac osx</a> |
    <a href="#linux">linux</a> |
    <a href="#android">android</a>

  <h3>Windows</h3>

  <p>
    We'll be using a tool called <a href="http://cmder.net">cmder</a>, which
    is a rather nice <a
    href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/images/trinity.jpg">terminal</a> that
    provides ssh stuff for you, too.
  </p>

  <h4>generating your keypair</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/latest">a zipped copy of cmder</a>.</li>
      <li>Extract cmder.zip</li>
      <li>Run the extracted Cmder.exe</li>
      <li>
        You should see a <strong>Cmder</strong> terminal window that looks sort of like this:
        <p>
          <img width="600" height="400" src="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/images/cmder.png">
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      copy and paste the following (paste by right clicking) into the
      <strong>Cmder</strong> window and hit <code>Enter</code>:
        <pre>
          mkdir .ssh || ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f .ssh/tilde.town
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>If it prompts to make a passphrase, just hit enter.</li>
      <li>
        Things should look like this:
        <p>
        <img width=600 height=400 src="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/images/cmder_generating.png">
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      Copy and paste the following (paste by right clicking) into <strong>Cmder</strong>:
        <pre>
          cat ~/.ssh/tilde.town.pub
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>Things should look like this:
        <p>
          <img width=600 height=400 src="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/images/cmder_cat.png">
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy the block that was output starting
        with <code>ssh-rsa</code> and paste it in the "SSH public key" field on the
        sign up form (copy by highlighting the text and pressing control + c).
      </li>
      <li>
        The other file that was generated (<code>.ssh/tilde.town</code>) is
        your private key. Treat it like a password and never share it with anyone.
      </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>using your key</h4>
  <p>
    Once <a href="https://tilde.town/~vilmibm">~vilmibm</a> or another admin
    approves your sign-up, you can connect to tilde.town.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open <strong>Cmder</strong>, which we unzipped in the last section.</li>
    <li>
      Type the following in the <strong>Cmder</strong> window and hit <code>Enter</code>:
      <pre>
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/tilde.town YOURUSERNAME@tilde.town
      </pre>
      Replace <code>YOURUSERNAME</code> with the username you signed up with. For example, if your username is <code>sharon_olds</code>, you would run this command:
      <pre>
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/tilde.town sharon_olds@tilde.town
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>generating your keypair</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <strong>Terminal</strong> (in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).</li>
    <li>
      In the <strong>Terminal</strong> window, copy and paste the following and press <code>Enter</code>:
      <pre>
        mkdir -m 700 ~/.ssh                          # Create your .ssh directory
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/tilde.town  # Create your keys
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Say no when it asks if you want to set a passphrase.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Terminal</strong> window, copy and paste the following and press <code>Enter</code>:
      <pre>
        cd ~/.ssh          # Go to the .ssh folder in your home folder
        cat tilde.town.pub # Outputs the content of your public key
      </pre>

  <h3>Linux</h3>

  <p>
    There are lots of different Linux distributions out there but they should
    all have <code>ssh</code>, <code>ssh-keygen</code>, and a terminal program.
    </p>

  <h4>generating your keypair</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Open a terminal.</li>
    <li>in the terminal window, copy and paste the following and press <code>Enter</code>:
      <pre>
        mkdir -m 700 ~/.ssh                           # Create a folder called .ssh. It's okay if it already exists.
        ssh-keygen -trsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/tilde.town # create the keypair
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Say no when it asks if you want to set a passphrase</li>
    <li>
      in the terminal window, copy and paste the following and press <code>Enter</code>:
      <pre>
        cd ~/.ssh          # Go to the .ssh folder in your home folder
        cat tilde.town.pub # Output the content of your public key
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Copy the block that gets output in the terminal starting with <code>ssh-rsa</code> and paste it in the <strong>SSH public key</strong> field on the signup form.
      </li>
    <li>The other file that was generated (<code>~/.ssh/tilde.town</code>) is
    your private key. Treat it like a password and never share it with anyone.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>using your keypair</h4>

    <li>Open your terminal program.</li>
    <li>
      Type the following in the terminal window and hit <code>Enter</code>:

        ssh -i ~/.ssh/tilde.town YOURUSERNAME@tilde.town
      </pre>
      Replace <code>YOURUSERNAME</code> with the username you signed up with.
      For example, if your username is <code>sharon_olds</code>, you would run
