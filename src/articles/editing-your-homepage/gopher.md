Gopher Wiki
============

[Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) is a pre-web internet protocol based on a hierarchy of menus and documents.
See below for useful links and clients for Gopher.

To get started with Gopher on the town, make a `public_gopher` directory in your home and it will be listed on the main menu of [gopher://tilde.town](gopher://tilde.town).
You can start immediately by putting various files and directories in your `public_gopher`, and they will be displayed on Gopher.
In addition, you can create a file named `gophermap` to add information, links, and labels for files.
