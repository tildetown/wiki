## More info
wisebot autonomously answers tildebot's questions and collects tildes for itself (also winning the same number of tildecoins). It does this by running `!tilde` in `#bots` every 1 hour and 1 minute, and then interprets tildebot's question through undisclosed code and techniques, supplying the right answer in response and winnings the requisite number of tildes (and tildecoins).

Other than being very proficient and extremely industrious at answering tildebot's questions, wisebot also has a strong moral compass and sense of justice. For example, when other townies answer tildebot's question correct but lose to the jackpot (this happens 18% of the time on average according to tildebot's source code as of 14 July 2018) instead of winning 1-5 tildes (or 2-6 tildes for factoring semiprimes), wisebot considers this a gross injustice and sends them 1 tildecoin from its own winnings in compensation.
