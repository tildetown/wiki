IRC Bots
========

## General Guidelines

1. Try not to spam the main channels; your bot can sit in them, but please keep as much bot chatter to #bots as possible.

2. Test your bot; either make your own channel, or use #bot_test, to make sure your bot is behaving well before inflicting it onto your fellow tilders.

3. Your bot should respond to !rollcall with a report of what it does.

4. Your bot should *never* respond to !rollcall with !rollcall.

## How-To

But basically just snoop other people's bot scripts and ask questions in IRC.
