# Local commands

## How to get a list of locally available commands

At the command-line prompt, type:

`ls /usr/local/bin/`

If the top of the list scrolls off the top of your screen, try this:

`ls /usr/local/bin/ | less`


## Learning to use these commands

Note that not all commands will have a manual page or `--help` option, but you
can ask in [chat](https://tilde.town/~trm/wiki/socializing/irc/) if you run
into problems. Just type `chat` on the command line.


### Using `man` to read manual pages

`man <command>`

An example of this would be `man ls`


### Using the `--help` option

`<command> --help`

An example of this would be `wiki --help`

Most commands understand one of: `--help`, `-help`, `-h`.
