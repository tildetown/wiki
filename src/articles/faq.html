<h2>can i run servers on tilde.town?</h2>
<p>sort of. currently, we don't open any ports for users to use; however,
you can run simple services or cron jobs for local-only access. please be
respectful of system resources. any admin has the right at any time to kill
any of your processes or cron tasks if the system is overloaded.</p>

<h2>can i run my own tilde site?</h2>
<p>of course, anyone can. if you'd like, the founder of tilde.town has made
available a <a href="https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde">puppet
module</a> that is a starting point for running your own tilde server. It's
fallen into a bit of disrepair, but should be a helpful starting off point.</p>
