#List of installed programming languages

*This list is incomplete, you can help by expanding it!*

In order of command-line executable name:

* `apl`
    * **APL** is a functional programming language developed in the 1960s. "Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)))
* `bc`
    * **Basic calculator** is "an arbitrary-precision calculator language." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(programming_language)))
* `bwbasic`
    * "**BASIC** (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC))
* `erl`
    * "**Erlang** is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, as well as a garbage-collected runtime system." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)))
* `gawk` / `awk`
    * "**AWK** is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK))
* `gcc`
    * "**C** is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)))
* `g++`
    * "**C++**  is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B))
* `ghc`
    * "**Haskell** is a standardized, general-purpose, purely functional programming language with non-strict semantics and strong static typing." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)))
* `go`
    * "**Go**, often referred to as **Golang**, is a statically typed, compiled language in the tradition of C, with the added benefits of memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)))
* `i7` (and `glulxe` for running `.ulx`)
    * "**Inform** is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform))
* `lua`
    * "**Lua** is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)))
* `nodejs` / `js`
    * "**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js))
* `perl`
    * **Perl 5** is a "general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. [...] Perl gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl))
* `Perl 6`
    * "Perl 5 and **Perl 6** differ fundamentally, though in general the intent has been to 'keep Perl 6 Perl', so that Perl 6 is clearly 'a perl programming language'. Most of the changes are intended to normalize the language, to make it easier for novice and expert programmers alike to understand, and to make 'easy things easier and hard things more possible'". ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6))
* `prolog` / `swipl`
    * "**Prolog** is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog))
* `python` and `python3`
    * "**Python** is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)))
* `ruby`
    * "**Ruby** is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)))
* `rustc`
    * "**Rust** is a systems programming language with a focus on safety, especially safe concurrency, supporting functional and imperative-procedural paradigms. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but its designers intend it to provide better memory safety while still maintaining performance." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)))

## Lisps

"**Lisp** (historically, **LISP**) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. [...] Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and **Scheme**." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)))

* `chicken` (scheme)
* `hy`
* `lumo` (node clojurescript)
* `racket`
* `picolisp`
* `sbcl` (steel bank common lisp)
