public_html (with a size of 144px &times; 144px) and run
`/home/login/cronjobs/update_tildebook` to have it added in as an `<iframe>`.

## gopher

gopher is a pre-web, text-only technology that uses a directory structure to
navigate documents instead of hyperlinks. tilde.town's server can be found at
gopher://tilde.town:70, and you can make your own gopherhole by creating
`public_gopher` in your home directory. you'll need a gopher-compatible browser
(try `lynx gopher://tilde.town:70`) to view gopher pages.
