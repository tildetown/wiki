Various games are available in Town. Here's a list of them.

## botany

[botany](https://github.com/jifunks/botany) is a command line virtual plant
buddy written by [curiouser](/~curiouser). At first you'll be given a seed
that will eventually grow into a beautiful plant, but it will do so only if
you remember to water it every 24 hours. After five days without water, your
beloved plant will die. To avoid that, you can ask your neighbors to water
your plant if you plan to be absent for a while. You can also take care of your
neighbors' plants too.

To start playing, just enter the following command:
